# IAGame Finite-State-Machine

Project to work on developping IA for gamevideo with finite states machine

Extend the "gold digger in the west" game application from the example in chapter 2 of Mat Buckland's book. More specifically, the version  "WestWorldWithMessaging". The goal is to introduce another agent-pnj, in the game world already composed of agents, Bob the gold digger.
The source code is available at http://www.aijunkie.com/books/toc_pgaibe.html 

It is about introducing a scenario of a quarrel inside a bar (bistro) between  agent Bob, when he is in a thirsty state, and another drunken agent, for example, who  for example, who starts an altercation when he is in a drunken state. The aim is therefore to add a new finite state machine to the application that describes the behaviour of the new agent.
